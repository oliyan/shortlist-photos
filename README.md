# shortlist-photos
A Native Nextcloud gallery app to shortlist photos uploaded in NextCloud. 

### The backstory for this app:
If I'm right, the tiresome & boring task in a wedding photographer's life would be sending 1000s of JPEGs  via Internet and get back around 250-300 photos for album-making from the clients.  

My clients would normally use a file manager (such as Windows explorer or Apple's Finder) to short list the photos i.e. Put the shortlisted photos in a separate folder -> Zip it -> and then email me.

## App idea:
The idea is to have an image gallery that would contain a tiny ✓ and ✗ below every thumbnail using which the users can shortlist the photos.

Probably two filter views to view the ✓ or ✗ photos alone. 

**Note:** App idea is partially inspired from -  [Picu - A wordpress plugin for soft proofing](https://picu.io/ "Picu - A similar wordpress plugin")

### Why Nextcloud
Nextcloud is an awesome open source alternative for Google drive (or) Dropbox where we get to own the server and it's data. I already have a nextcloud server set up and running in my home which I use to transfer photos/videos to my clients and vendors. 

Since Nextcloud is free to use and open source, I think we can write a standalone web app (or even better - a native nextcloud app) for this purpose which would make our lives much easier. 

### Like the idea? 
Then share me your suggestions/insights on building this app. Let's code in python and make it open source. What say?
